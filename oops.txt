coreyxkenshin is the goat
i want to sleep early today
after doing my night routine
my brain is telling me to play Last of us for 30 minutes to an hour
but the time right now is 1:38AM :( 
I need to go to sleep instead of playing my game
I can play for like 30 minutes if I want
either the game or watch coreyxkenshin for a little and then straight to night routine
I am happy I finished some of my ccwc python program
I still have a long way to go though :(
Not really, i just need to make sure the total works for each argument type with multiple files passed in
